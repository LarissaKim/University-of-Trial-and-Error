<p>Source: Designing Products People Love: How Great Designers Create Successful Products by Scott Hurff</p>
<h2>Product/Service Creation Model</h2>
<h3>Hunt and synthesize</h3>
<p>Goal: Completely understand your audience</p>
<p>Research to discover a pain point/need of target audience being underfulfilled or overlooked.
• Who is the customer for which your product exists?
• Where do these people congregate online?
• What do you understand about them? What can you learn about them by reading their forum posts, App Store reviews, or support emails?
• Plot their pains on the Pain Matrix. Compare it to the problems your product is currently tackling. How do they match up? What has your product been missing?</p>
<p>Observe what your customers are already doing and turns those habits into the basis for product ideas. Focus on the way the person writes, how they see the world, or how they argue a particular point.
• What they actually do in real life on the Internet
• What they read
• What they share with each other
• The problems they discuss
• What things that they ask help for. How they help others
• What forums, mailing lists, and link-sharing sites do they frequent?
• What are they writing in customer support emails or product reviews?</p>
<h3>Build</h3>
<p>The main build team should be a Two-Pizza team (about six people). Only allow team members in if they’re educated on the research conducted on your audience (Pain Matrix).</p>
<h5>Build Meeting</h5>
<p>Whiteboards help you remember what was said, allow you to be visual, and disassociate ideas from their inventors. This allows the best ideas to win without any regard for who invented them.</p>
<p>Amazon’s “Working Backwards” approach can help you pinpoint the product ideas that’ll solve your customer’s pains, versus creating something that’s too flashy or uninspired.</p>
<p>Leave this meeting with the product guide - an outline of what you’re building, why you’re doing it (problems you’re trying to solve), what success looks like (quantitatively and qualitatively), who’s responsible for doing it, and when they’ll be done.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>Start by listing exactly what the user will do to achieve their goals and how the system will respond to each user action. Focus on the who and why of your product, not the how and what.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by mapping out each user flow in your product. Then, dial down into each screen.</li>
<li>Keep each screen low fidelity. Write out all of your hopes and dreams for each screen. List every element that could possibly be on the screen, then eliminate what you don’t need. Remember the centerpoint and purpose of each screen—what does your audience need to understand what’s going on? What elements do they need to make the right decision along each step?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creating User Flows</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Map out the order of interactions (flows) your audience will use to complete every task in your product.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Does this step need to be a single screen, or could it just be a pop-up window?</li>
<li>Do you need another form on this step, or could you just reuse existing data from a previous screen?</li>
<li>Will you need a double confirmation because you’re dealing with a potentially destructive action?</li>
<li>Where are people starting in your design: from within your product? Or are they coming to a page from outside of it?</li>
<li>What are the assumptions your customers have at this point: are the customers new? Exploratory? Cautious? Or are they experienced and trying to get a task done as quickly possible?</li>
<li>What are the possible decisions your customers can make on each screen—and where does each decision take them?</li>
<li>What pieces of data do you need to have available?</li>
<li>On the flip side, what pieces of data do you need your customers to input?</li>
<li>What happens if something goes wrong—or right? What do you display? Where do you direct customers?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>For each screen in these flows, list out the components that are required to make each step in the flow do what it’s supposed to do. (e.g. forms, buttons, pieces of data).</li>
<li>Write the actual copy. What’s the headline going to say? What’s the context? In what tone should you write it, and should you reflect a certain personality? Don’t settle for Lorem Ipsum here.</li>
</ol>
<p>By mapping out the most essential flows first, you can then orient every other flow around them; the secondary functionality of your product should be in service to the primary flows.</p>
<p><strong>Flow Strategies</strong></p>
<p>Write out the content for each page. Turn text into raw HTML prototype with no styling and try clicking through, making sure it felt like the right flows and things fit together right and the information architecture was right, then increasing fidelity from there. This forces you to be linear. Then you start to think about importance. What’s going to be further down within the content, or what’s going to be higher within the content—whether or not you break them into separate pages or different flows, you start to prioritize and give the content a hierarchy just based on the amount of things before it. Doing this forces you to whittle down your content and make things shorter and smaller and more succinct and you start to rearrange stuff around.</p>
<p>How does the customer get into a position to complete a task? How do they complete these tasks? Where do they go afterward? What are the potential hangups? And how are these communicated? Sketches? Diagrams? Mind maps?</p>
<ul>
<li>Design the product’s interface first</li>
<li>write the interface</li>
<li>create and analyze user flows</li>
<li>build prototypes</li>
<li>evolve interface on top of prototype</li>
</ul>
<h3>Test and level up</h3>
<h3>Launch, monitor, and start over</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Design everything on the assumption that people are not heartless or stupid but marvelously capable, given the chance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>- John Chris Jones in The Internet and Everyone</em></p>
<p>Know where your target audience hangs out &amp; speak to them in an authentic way.</p>
<p>Analyze how people used technology, learned what brought them joy, and understood especially well what pissed them off.
What do we hate? (Our cellphones) What do we have the technology to make? (A cellphone with a computer inside) What would we like to own? (a smartphone)
The next time Apple has a keynote, listen to how they pitch their product. Where do they get their information? What data do they provide? Reading between the lines during these presentations
can teach you a great deal about the value and practice of research.</p>
<p>Instead of making something entirely new, you mimic and mix until you get something that fits with everything else that was already interesting but has the integrity to stand on its own.</p>
<p>Gathering tons of data points means that you’ll start to notice patterns trickling into your notes. Eventually, you’ll be able to categorize them: How does your audience see the world? What do they dwell on? How do they speak? What products do they use? And, eventually, you’ll start noticing the most important element of all: what your audience’s problems are, written in their own words.</p>
<p>Goal: have a systematic and repeatable approach, so you can collect a ton of it. A ton of data, because without a ton of data, you can’t find the patterns. Without patterns, you can’t make smart decisions about the business.</p>
<h4>Pain Matrix</h4>
<p>Upper right
Frequently occurring, intense pain. If a product can alleviate whatever is plaguing your audience in this quadrant, this is where you want to be to bring the most joy to your audience.
Hate, fear, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, feeling stupid, getting
stuck, wasting precious time</p>
<p>Lower right
Infrequent, yet intense pain. Products in this category might be nice-to-haves, surprising your audience if they were properly addressed.
Procrastination, self-doubt, guilt</p>
<p>Upper left
Little pinpricks of pain that occur often. Products in this category might address smaller problems like administrative challenges or things that people label “it is what it is,” and provide a customer “little wins.”
Minor irritations, dislikes</p>
<p>Lower left
Little pain happening infrequently. This is something that might appear like an opportunity while steeped in the details of your data, but reveals itself to be a low-opportunity product to build
when you step back to look at the bigger picture.
Boredom</p>
<p>A digital product’s purpose is to serve a customer. A product designer’s primary job is to understand the audience they’ve chosen to serve.</p>
<p>“How do we build tools to help our users solve their problems?”
You only get to the big picture if individually everyone is gaining value out of your service.</p>
<ol>
<li>Map out the sequences of interactions—otherwise known as flows—that your audience will use to complete every task in your product.</li>
<li>For each screen in these flows, list out the components that are required to make each step in the flow do what it’s supposed to do. Forms? Buttons? Pieces of data? List everything out.</li>
<li>Write the actual copy. What’s the headline going to say? What’s the context? In what tone should you write it, and should you reflect a certain personality? Don’t settle for Lorem Ipsum here.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Does this step need to be a single screen, or could it just be a pop-up window?</li>
<li>Do you need another form on this step, or could you just reuse existing data from a previous screen?</li>
<li>Will you need a double confirmation because you’re dealing with a potentially destructive action?</li>
<li>Where are people starting in your design: from within your product? Or are they coming to a page from outside of it?</li>
<li>What are the assumptions your customers have at this point: are the customers new? Exploratory? Cautious? Or are they experienced and trying to get a task done as quickly possible?</li>
<li>What are the possible decisions your customers can make on each screen—and where does each decision take them?</li>
<li>What pieces of data do you need to have available?</li>
<li>On the flip side, what pieces of data do you need your customers to input?</li>
<li>What happens if something goes wrong—or right? What do you display? Where do you direct customers?</li>
</ul>
<p>By mapping out the most essential flows first, you can then orient every other flow around them; the secondary functionality of your product should be in service to the primary flows.</p>
<p>Write out the content for each page. Turn text into raw HTML prototype with no styling and try clicking through, making sure it felt like the right flows and things fit together right and the information architecture was right, then increasing fidelity from there. This forces you to be linear. Then you start to think about importance. What’s going to be further down within the content, or what’s going to be higher within the content—whether or not you break them into separate pages or different flows, you start to prioritize and give the content a hierarchy just based on the amount of things before it. Doing this forces you to whittle down your content and make things shorter and smaller and more succinct and you start to rearrange stuff around.</p>
<p>How does the customer get into a position to complete a task? How do they complete these tasks? Where do they go afterward? What are the potential hangups? And how are these communicated? Sketches? Diagrams? Mind maps?</p>
<h4>Writing Screens</h4>
<p>Successful screens are aware of the screens that came before them and appear after them.
List everything that you think needs to be on this specific screen of your product, anything that your product requires to successfully fulfill its promise to your audiencey, a prompt to the user about what they should do, the primary action you’d like them to take, and any bits of information that you can supply to them that makes their decision easier.
What are the essential interface elements that you need to convey the purpose of this screen? What’s everything you need for the ideal state of this screen?
• User information like name, age, biography, job title, etc.
• Common connections like friends, interests, or visited locations to which two or more people could share
• Photos, videos, and any kind of rich media
• Core and secondary actions the user could take</p>
<h4>Good Interface Copy</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Who’s the Audience?</p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s using your product?</li>
<li>How comfortable are they with your product on any given screen?</li>
<li>Are they just now being introduced to your product’s capabilities, or are they veteran customers?</li>
<li>Have they paid for anything yet, or are they on a free plan?</li>
<li>What words and terminology will be most recognizable by your customers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In What Tone Is It Written?
Goal: communicate your product’s capability of fulfilling its promise—that it can be relied upon to do the job it said it can do.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>isn’t overly technical, vague, or laden with branded or internal buzzwords.</li>
<li>It’s helpful and forgiving</li>
<li>It’s aware of when it’s delivering good or bad news.</li>
<li>Is your product for stockbrokers? Teenage girls? Book authors? Eco-conscious mothers?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>What’s the Context?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Is it a landing page? A signup form? Settings? The first time a customer sees a screen? Your shipping policy? In response to something on which they explicitly took action?</li>
<li>Goal: create short, direct, easily absorbed copy that succinctly describes every decision in which a customer might find themselves. The goal is to make those situations effortlessly understandable—so your customer knows what to do next without question.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Are You Being Consistent?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Can you “Log In,” then “Sign Out”? Do you advance by tapping “Continue” or “Next”? Do confirmations come with “OK,” “Okay,” “Submit,” or “Confirm”? Universal commands should be consistent across your product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware of common industry terms and the geographical region in which your product is being used.
Be aware of how you’re representing dates. Most countries present the day before the month.</p>
<p>Get something working as quickly as possible intersects at the center of these four constraints:
<strong>Fidelity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does the format communicate your design ideas with the appropriate level of precision?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeframe</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How much time can you spend communicating your design ideas?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s going to be vetting your design ideas? What do they need to see to understand them?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comfort</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How comfortable are you with the tools you’re using?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Goals of Prototyping</h4>
<p>test, prove, or conceptualize an idea that’s in your head within a limited timeframe or budget.
reflect who’s going to see it
understand where your interaction or flow falls short.
What parts are implausible to build or too over-the-top? Where do people get confused? What parts could use more personality or ingenuity? How could these changes inform other parts of your product?</p>
<p>the entire loop usually took a week, at most two weeks, for each prototype to be created, tested, iterated upon, and readied for implementation. (Small teams can take one business day).</p>
<h4>The UI Stack: Five States of Interface Design</h4>
<p><strong>Ideal State</strong>
All UI states lead to the ideal state.
This is the first state to create. This is when your product is providing maximum value and is full of useful, actionable content.</p>
<p><strong>Empty State</strong> (including first-time use)
Version 1: First-time use/onboarding
Your one shot to describe what your customer will see when data exists
Encourage action, help them understand the value they’re going to get out of this screen</p>
<ul>
<li>Be encouraging and uplifting in your copywriting, and speak plainly about what to do, the exact button to press and why they should press it.</li>
<li>Use your product’s content to instruct your customer about what to do (e.g. messaging app includes message in customer’s inbox. Subject line tells customer how to open message, content discusses more about how to manipulate and reply to a message )</li>
<li>Offer an example screenshot of what the screen will look like in the ideal state</li>
<li>Monitor your customer’s progress and respond accordingly (e.g. live chat prompt when customer pauses too long on a screen)</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 2: seen when your customer voluntarily clears existing data from the screen
Example: customer completed all of the items on their to-do list, read all of their notifications, archived all of their emails, or finished downloading all of their music.
This is a customer who’s engaged with your product. Reward them or spur further action to keep them in the flows your product has in place by doing the work for them.</p>
<p>Version 3: when there isn’t anything to show
Ideally, give the closest matching result while showing which terms it didn’t match. Turn search term into pillbox for easy deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Error State</strong>
Goal: keeps all user input safe. Your product shouldn’t undo, destroy, or delete anything entered or uploaded by your customer in the event of an error.
handle errors in graceful and accommodating ways
shouldn’t be dramatic, nor should they be vague</p>
<p>great error messages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written with your specific customer in mind.</li>
<li>Constructive, clear, and helpfully specific.</li>
<li>Positive—not intimidating or overly dramatic.</li>
<li>Presented with the core of the error first, and, if possible, an inferred solution.</li>
<li>Specific about exactly what is in error.</li>
<li>As timely as possible.</li>
<li>Written in grammatically and thematically correct language, without jargon and excessive abbreviation.</li>
<li>Offered with clear paths or options to resolution, and without excessive requirements (especially in the event of password security).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Partial State</strong>
the page is no longer empty and sparsely populated.
Goal: prevent people from getting discouraged and giving up on your product.
Acceleration
Helps user visualize their future in the product, guiding them along a predefined series of tasks to complete to achieve this vision. User shouldn’t realize they’re performing what could be perceived as tedium in order to extract the maximum value from your product.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loading State
UI states smoothly transition from one to another, and as many times as necessary.
Be mindful of how you represent situations where you’re fetching data. This can consist of an entire page takeover, lazy loading of content panes, or inline loading.</li>
<li>Skeleton screens place the focus on the content as it loads versus the fact that the content is loading</li>
<li>Assuming success with optimistic actions</li>
</ul>
<p>Cross-platform
your product exists to find a customer, and it stays alive by solving their pains. Living on a new platform doesn’t change this unbreakable rule.</p>
<p>Responsive navigation: http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1649</p>
<p>http://uxdiogenes.com/blog/on-being-a-designer-and-a-developer-not-quite-unicorn-rare</p>
<p>It may be a little bit more on the interface, but it’s perfectly clear; they don’t have to think about it. They don’t have to wonder what’s going on. You don’t have to give them that feeling of them not being good at using this interface by just putting this label there, and letting them [flounder].
There’s a fine line, I guess, between not patronizing someone, but also realizing that they’re not necessarily a student of interfaces, or interested in learning at all. Because they just want to get X thing done before they move on with their life.</p>
<p>While technology is changing really, really rapidly, human motivations basically haven’t at all. Like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, that’s still the same. Designing around that, the closer you are to the base level of what humans desire, the more timeless it’ll be.</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<p>For product loops to be effective, they need to incorporate a number of psychological factors. Is it inviting a desirable experience? Is it novel or new? Is it appearing at the correct time?
it needs to take root in your customer’s mind that it’s worth pursuing because it has payoff.
loops can also be used for activation and retention.</p>
<p>Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do
motivation, ability, and triggers must converge at the same moment for a behavior to occur.
Motivators</p>
<ul>
<li>sensation (pleasure, pain),</li>
<li>anticipation (hope, fear)</li>
<li>belonging (social rejection, social acceptance).
when we make a behavior simpler to perform, the ability of the person increases
The goal of the trigger is to —gently facilitating a customer’s progression through a sequence of events as they gradually perform the desired behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>ADDITIVE ACTIONS
Introduce new/related features in the pre-existing flow in an unobtrusive way (e.g. tooltip dialog)</p>
<p>Variable rewards
positive reinforcement is received after a seemingly unpredictable number of actions by the user. It causes the user to continue usage until receiving positive reinforcement again.
The product is being used by consumers. How can you make their day better via fun interactions?</p>
<p>Aesthetics and Personality
attractive interfaces with high aesthetic qualities arouse attention, are easier to learn, produce more harmonious results and work better.
create a memorable experience that makes a human connection.</p>
<p>Animation and Motion
Motion accounts for the passage of time, and helps your customer follow what happens after
they take an action.</p>
<p>Animations tell the story of why and how an element appeared or disappeared or how you got from one screen to another. Think about the elements on your screen as actors. We like to be introduced and we want to know what happens to them.</p>

<li>confine motion to what matters</li>

<p>Basics of Visual Design</p>
<p>• Visual hierarchy: presentation of visual elements on a layout</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarity</li>
<li>Actionability</li>
<li>Affordance: looks or behaves like what it does
• Composition: arrangement and proportion</li>
<li>Consistency: predictable and uniform</li>
<li>Alignment
• Color</li>
<li>put dark foregrounds against light backgrounds, and vice versa (test by making grayscale)</li>
<li>reinforce red/green critical decisions with different shape/text (for colourblind)</li>
<li>avoid color combinations that fatigue the eye (e.g. complimentary colour text/background, white for lots of blank space)</li>
<li>warm vs cool</li>
<li>warm: Red, orange, yellow, brown, and beige</li>
<li>cool: Blue, green, purple, gray (in large quantities), and white</li>
<li>dark vs. light background</li>
<li>dark screens can feel edgier, more somber, or more energetic</li>
<li>High versus low contrast</li>
<li>Strong contrast evokes tension, strength, and boldness</li>
<li>low contrast is more soothing and relaxing
<ul>
<li>Saturated vs unsaturated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highly saturated, or pure, colors evoke energy, vividness, brightness, and warmth. They are daring; they have character. But when overused, they can tire the eyes so use them sparingly (one or two)</li>
<li>Muted colors, either dark (tones) or light (tints) make up the bulk of most color palettes</li>
<li>Combinations of hues</li>
<li>one saturated color with a set of muted colors creates dimensionality; brighter and stronger colors appear closer to the viewer, whereas the grayer and paler colors recede.</li>
<li>Flatter designs, with more muted or lighter colors, are calmer</li>
<li>Don’t rely on color alone: convey by doubling up with color and shape
• Typography</li>
<li>Types of typefaces (= font style)</li>
<li>Serif: most common typefaces for reading dense amounts of text</li>
<li>Sans serif: more contemporary look, hold their legibility at smaller</li>
<li>Display: establish the look and feel of a brand (i.e. headline, logo)</li>
<li>Monospace: equal distance between letters</li>
<li>Font pairing</li>
<li>same family: use a different weight or style (bold, italic) to differentiate the text sizes</li>
<li>don’t combine similar typeface (avoid by pairing serif w/ sans serif)</li>
<li>Numbers: make sure they aren’t confused for letters (l vs 1, O vs 0)
• Readability
• Evoking a feeling</li>
<li>Spaciousness and crowding</li>
<li>Spaciousness gives an impression of airiness, openness, quiet, calmness, freedom, or stateliness and dignity</li>
<li>Crowded designs can evoke urgency or tension under some circumstances</li>
<li>Angles and curves</li>
<li>straight up-and-down lines and right angles generally looks calmer and more still</li>
<li>many different angles has more apparent motion</li>
<li>a lot of circles and circular arcs can be calming and restful</li>
<li>carefully chosen curves in an otherwise rectangular design add sophistication and interest</li>
<li>geometrical tangents where two curves intersect:</li>
<li>right angles results in a calmer, more still composition</li>
<li>acute angles has more tension and apparent motion</li>
<li>location of focal points: sharp angles, where lines cross, and where multiple lines converge; use to direct viewer’s eye
• Images</li>
