<h2>From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions</h2>
<p>Identify the information that must be represented and how it is represented in the chosen programming language. Formulate data definitions and illustrate them with examples.</p>
<h2>Signature, Purpose Statement, Header</h2>
<p>State what kind of data the function consumes and produces. Formulate a concise answer to the question: &quot;What does this function compute?&quot; Define a stub that lives up to the signature.</p>
<h2>Functional Examples</h2>
<p>Work through the examples to illustrate the function's purpose.</p>
<h2>Function Template</h2>
<p>Translate the data definitions into an outline of the function.</p>
<h2>Function Definition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Function name</li>
<li>Parameter
Fill in the gaps in the function template. Exploit the purpose statement and the examples.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Articulate the examples as tests and ensure that the function passes all. Doing so discovers mistakes. Tests also supplement examples; they help others read and understand the definition when the need arises.</p>
<p>Iterative Refinement: stripping away all inessential details at first and finding a solution for the remaining core problem</p>
<ul>
<li>A refinement step adds in one of these omitted detaisla and resolves the expanded problem, using the existing solution as much as possible</li>
<li>An interation (repetition) of these refinement steps eventually leads to a complete solution</li>
</ul>
